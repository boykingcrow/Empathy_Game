You’d best get finding that welder, propulsion module, life support module, and A.I.

*  [Begin collecting ship debris.]

You pick up smaller debris in your immediate area and put them into a pile. So far so good. It dawns on you that perhaps (read: obviously) it’s better to gather the larger sections of ship first. You pick up a small flat piece of hull and tie it to a rod with… you don’t have any rope. Or cord. Or even laces. Hand axe it is. You  collect a flat-ish metallic piece from the debris pile and rub it against a rock until it looks kind-of sort-of sharp.

        **With no wood in sight[...]

        <>, you hope for the best and begin hacking at one of the massive stalks of fungi. The plan — if the fungi is wood-ish enough — is to use many many stalks as rollers, to ferry the large debris. If it worked for the Egyptians, it will work for you. By yourself. Without rope, or wood — you cut into the spongy stalk again and again. 

            ***[On second thought, this is a terrible idea...]

    *[Time passes.] 

        **You spot the creature[.] 

        <> passing through strange foliage.

            ***[continue.]

-You watch it from a distance. The creature doesn’t walk. It floats. Propels itself through the atmosphere like some liquid. It is picking through some debris. It wraps a tendril around a small piece of alloy. It (you think) examines the piece with its unblinking eye until something else catches its attention. The something else is a faint purple glow radiating from under the chunk of your ship. 

    *[The creature probes at the ship-chunk.] 
    
        ** [It pokes.] 
        
            ***[It prods.] 
            
-It gently runs appendages along the surface. It digs several of its larger limbs into the ground and straightens them. It grasps the chunk and pushes against it. The chunk groans and creaks...

    *[But does not give.] 

-The creature flashes bright pink. It paces — or whatever the floating organism’s equivalent of pacing is — for a moment before turning to the ship-chunk and... 

    *[Staring at it.]

        **[The strange star that warms the planet gets a little lower.] 

            ***[A pair of moons peek out from above the tall mushroom-like trees.] 

                ****[Motion catches the corner of your eye.] 

                    You focus your attention back onto the creature. It is still staring at the chunk. Something gaseous, thick and glowing flows from the creature. The substance dances and grows, separates into droplets and merges into streams. Whatever it is, it envelopes the chunk of ship. The chunk once again creaks and moans. And lifts. Just a little, and rolls away. Revealing a brightly glowing BLUE crystal.
                
                *****[continue.]

                The creature floats over to the crystal, excavates it, and pulls it into itself. You hear a crunching. The tendril emerges empty. The creature radiates bright GREEN and wanders out of view.

-What now?

    *[Search for the welder.]
    *[Search for the propulsion.]
    *[Search for the life support.]
    *[Search for the A.I.]

-Having already ransacked the largest and closest chunk of you ship, you gather your meager stash of things and start walking.
