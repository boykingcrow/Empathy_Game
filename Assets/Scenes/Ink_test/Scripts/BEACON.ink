=== BEACON ===

*AI:[...]
<> Alright, this is the perfect spot for a distress beacon.

**AI:[...]
<>  Now all we need is, well, the beacon part. We’ll have to pull those from the alien ship, obviously -- here’s the thing though. We have the same big problem we always did of "how?" -- savvy?

***[Not following.]
Sigh.
***[I see.]
Don’t pretend to be in-the-know now, it’s unbecoming of a strapping young turd.

-You see, murderer, you are hardly one-handed Heracles reincarnate. And as we’ve no doubt mentioned, we have ZERO appendages. Even if we can snag parts from that big scary hunk, we can’t LIFT them.

****[We’ll find a way.]
You: We’ll find a way, through science!
	*****AI:[...]
    <> Oh! That’s adorable!
    ->convo2
****[The creature can.]

-AI: What now? I know it’s got loud of appendages, unlike us, but they hardly look like forklifts.

****[It does a thing.]
AI: Ohhh… It does a THING! How helpful.
*****[It can make those angry fish-things explode.]
AI: Well, we don’t see how that’s relevant to… wait. You don’t mean...
*****[It makes bubbles.]
AI: Bubbles!? How in the… wait. What do these bubbles do?

*[It lifts things. Big things. I’ve seen it.]
**AI:[...]
<> YES! Yes! Oh lord yes!
***AI:[...]
<> Honestly? Up until this point we were just stringing you along with false hopes of escape to torture you.
****AI:[...]
<> But if the creature can do what you say it can, we might actually… maybe… supposedly... get off this stupid rock!->parts

= parts
*AI:[...]
<> We’ll need at least 4 things in order to cobble together a beacon. In order of heaviness:

**1) A computation unit.
We can probably rip one from the chunk where you found us -- shouldn’t be too banged up.
***2) A comms relay.
Don’t worry your pretty little head about what that even IS, murderer. We need it, it does a thing, grab it from the alien ship.
****3) An antennae.
A big long metal rod. Think you can manage to find one?
*****4) A warp coil. 
That is, the coil-y bits of a Warp Drive. They’ll be in the alien ship’s engine room.
******[continue.]
-After our scavenger hunt we’ll need to interface with the thing. To do that, we’ll need you to do your duty as our new Empathy Module and tell us what some of those emotional colors match with.
**AI:[...]
<> You follow?
	***[No.]
	***[Yes.]
-Great! Now get out there and do your corporate overlords proud, scamp!
